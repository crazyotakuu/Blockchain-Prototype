The assignment will focus on using Python Sockets to exchange messages between clients.

Establishing the foundational framework for a "gossip" protocol is the aim.

which, when receiving a message, determines whether it has already received it and

If not, forward the message to its colleagues.  



Students will use Python to update their prior project work.

To create connections between other (local) nodes, use socket communication.

By attaching to the same localhost server, several nodes can connect to

distinct ports. Every node used with local nodes ought to be included within
