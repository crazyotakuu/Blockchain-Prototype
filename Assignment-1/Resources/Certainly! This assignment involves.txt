Certainly! This assignment involves creating two Python files, transaction.py and block.py, each with specific functionalities. Together, these files will form a basic blockchain-like structure. Let's break down the requirements and I'll explain how to implement them.

1. transaction.py
Functionality:
Prompt the user for transaction data.
Store the transaction data as a JSON object.
Save the JSON object to a file with the filename being the SHA-256 hash of the content stored in the file.
Detailed Explanation:
Prompt User for Transaction Data:

You will need to use the input() function to prompt the user for transaction data. This data will typically include details like From, To, and Amount.
Store as JSON and Save to File:

After obtaining the transaction data, you'll create a Python dictionary with the required fields (Timestamp, From, To, Amount).
Convert this dictionary to JSON format using the json.dumps() function.
Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the JSON content. You can use the hashlib library for this purpose.
Save the JSON content to a file with the filename as the calculated hash.
Example of a saved transaction file:
57bc6f8255b180cbaf73f286b107be0506713b32cfe8f41af29e5c1e17f8ca6d.json

Content:
{
  "timestamp": 1660791892,
  "from": "me",
  "to": "you",
  "amount": 100000
}
2. block.py
Functionality:
Process pending transactions and create a block.
Move processed transactions to a "processed" folder.
Save the block as a JSON object.
Detailed Explanation:
Process Pending Transactions:

This involves gathering pending transactions. In your case, you'll need to read transaction files from a folder (which can be named pending or any other name you choose).
Create a Block:

A block will consist of two main parts: a header and a body.
The body will be a list of transactions included in the block. These transactions are the ones read from the pending folder.
The header will include fields like Block Height, Timestamp, Previous Block Hash, and Hash of the Block Body. You'll need to set these values accordingly.
Move Processed Transactions:

After creating the block, move the processed transactions to a "processed" folder (or any folder you choose to designate).
Save Block as JSON:

Similar to the transaction, you'll convert the block (both header and body) to JSON format and save it to a file.
The filename should be the SHA-256 hash of the header content.
Example of a saved block file:
87febaa161ff01e32468b5a7f48bc64ea71ca02b9c21a10eba177b9ac115bad1.json

Content:
{
  "header": {
    "height": 0,
    "timestamp": 1660792000,
    "previousblock": "NA",
    "hash": "a82149a5665faffa8dd01b516b8468c1a8dc7254eeea9471ab76bf4165213b40"
  },
  "body": [
    {
      "hash": "57bc6f8255b180cbaf73f286b107be0506713b32cfe8f41af29e5c1e17f8ca6d",
      "content": {
        "timestamp": 1660791892,
        "from": "me",
        "to": "you",
        "amount": 100000
      }
    }
  ]
}
Block Height Determination:
You have multiple options to determine block height:

Prompt the user for confirmation (as mentioned in the assignment).
Read existing block files and determine the one with the highest height.
Save the last block ID into a file and read that file. If it's empty, start a new chain.
Implementation Approach:
Decide which method you want to use to determine block height.
Implement the functionalities described above in transaction.py and block.py following the detailed explanations.
Test your program by running transaction.py to create transactions, and then run block.py to process and create blocks.
Remember to handle file operations (reading, writing, moving files) using Python's built-in os module. Also, use json module for working with JSON data.
