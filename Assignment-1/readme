Executing this program is simple

First execute the transaction.py and it prompts for 3 inputs - sender details(From), recipient details(To), Amount.

Taking in all the inputs, it creates a transaction file in the pending folder.

Now run the block.py file, it takes all the transactions in the pending folder and processes them.

When block.py file gets executed, it takes all the transactions in the pending folder and creates a block file. It places the block file
in the blocks folder and all the processed transactions in the processed folder.

It additionally creates a blockdetails.json where we store the current height of the blocks and the last block created.
